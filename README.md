## Features

### Welcome screen

- The welcome screen is the first thing the user sees from the battleship app. Here the large letters "Welcome to Battleship!" can be seen, as well as the question "Do you want to start the game (y/n)?. The (y/n) indicates the possible input. By typing in y the user can progress with the game. While n will stop the game from running. If the user gives any other input, the user will be asked again to answer the question correct. The y and n answer will be automatically commented.
