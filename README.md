## UX

### Website owner goals

As the owner of the website I want to sells different bags for everyone:
- Within the first two month I want to sell 100 bags.
- Within the first six month I want to have 100 registered repeat buyers and I want to sell 1000 bags.
- Each month I want to have at least 100 persons visiting my website.

### E-commerce application Type

- **Who is the customer?:**  
    - It is a business to customer model (B2C). We have to attract the consumers to choose to make impulsive purchases. Our customers are going to be of all kind of genders and all ages. People who want to buy quality bags anytime or those who want to buy a bargain can find what they are looking for on the website. Therefore the customers can get different kinds of informations on the products on our website. 
- **What will they buy?:** 
    - The physical products we are selling are different bags for different occassions and customers.
- **How will they pay?:** 
    - The customers can pay via one time payment. They can save their payment methods to make it easier for the next time.
- **Type:** 
    - Our application type is a typical online shop (e-commerce).

### Five planes of UX

#### Strategy
The users are identified as parents or persons from around 10 to 65 years old which are used to order online and are in need for a new bag. Their needs are different bags on a site with simple and easy selection, payment methods, authentication system and information on the bags.

#### Scope
To achieve the strategy, we must bring online an easy to handle website. Therefore, we need a visible search bar as well as the information on free shipping displayed on the homepage. A menu for category filtering for women, men, children, occasions and sales must be included. The wanted products must show the minimum needed information such as price, material, image and rating for the customer to narrow down the wanted product. The product detail page should show everything needed for a purchase which includes the price, material, image, rating and the option to choose the amount wanted. The shopping bag, should be easily visible on the pages, as well as the option to register or login. In the shopping bag, all selected products must be visible with price and the chosen amount as well as the option to change the amount. The total price and the option for check out should be easily visible. An intuitive purchasing process must be included with different payment options and the purchase confirmation. For details, the [features](#features) section can be viewed.

#### Structure
For the interaction design, the user is actively requested on the homepage to start their shopping experience, which shows them all the available products. Before or after choosing this option, the user can use the search for specific materials or bag type or the category filter. The users can view all the details before their purchase.
For the information architecture, the potential customer can see all minimum needed information in the displayed list of products and more on the detailed products page.
Authenticated users can store their information.

#### Skeleton
As most common, the navigation, filter, register, login and search bars are within the top lines of the website. Number of search results are displayed in the left corner of the main section and the search results themselves are displayed in rows and column are adapted to the respective screen size, and they can be sorted. Which means in general, that standard layouts are used, which the users should be familiar with. The thoughts on the look of the website can be seen in the [wireframes](#wireframes) section.

#### Surface
For the font family Roboto is used and for the color scheme a beige background should smooth the black and white color scheme of the upper lines. The font color of the main part of the screen is black or dark red which gives a nice contrast to the white of the product card and the main background color.
All relevant options and information are altogether sorted in intuitive groups. 
The images and icons are mainly used to help navigation and for product details. Therefore, only necessary ones are used.

### Long-tail keyword testing

For the long-tail keyword testing the website Wordtracker was used. Examplary results are shown below. The competition and volume was not in general low. That is why the keywords used as meta tags were chosen based on these results and the results of the [Search results for keywords](#search-results-for-keywords).

![seo1](readme-images/seo1.png)

![seo2](readme-images/seo2.png)

![seo3](readme-images/seo3.png)

### Search for similar businesses

For comparison, different pages with different layouts were viewed. 
For example: zalando.de, bonprix.de, rucksack.de, taschenkaufhaus.de

## Marketing strategies

Paid marketing strategies were no options and requirements for this fictional project that is why the main strategies used are social media and email marketing to adress people of different ages and preferences. 

### Social media marketing

You can see below a mock facebook page where the promotion takes place with regular posts about our new collections and sales. This provides a chance for the customers to feel more connected with the business and stay easily informed about new sales or collections without the need to visit the main page regularly.

![facebookpage](readme-images/facebookpage.png)

### Email marketing

In the footer section of the main page a newsletter sign up section is included. Therefore the MailChimp Newsletter subscription service is used. The sign up is easy and completely optional.

## Deployment

For deployment:
- create a new database <https://dbs.ci-dbs.net/>
- A Heroku account must be created.
- Set your GitHub repository to public.
- Create a new app in Heroku with the following settings:
    - Add the DATABASE_URL to config vars in settings
- Within the project:
    - Connect to database
    - Create database tables
    - Add shop fixtures
    - Create a superuser

    Create an app on Heroku, as we have done for previous projects.

    Create a database. For this we’ll use PostgreSQL from Code Institute, as the Heroku add-ons are not available on the Student Pack.

    Set up hosting for our static and media files with AWS (Amazon Web Services). Specifically, we will use S3 (“Simple Storage Service”) for this.


The deployment was done after the tutorial in the course content using <https://www.heroku.com/>.

For deployment:
- A Heroku account must be created.
- Set your GitHub repository to public.
- Create a new app in Heroku with the following settings:
  - Add Python and Node.js (in this order!)
  - Add PORT as key and 8000 as value
- The Heroku App must be linked to the correct repo in GitHub
- Choose Automatic Deploys for easier handling.
- Then deploy
